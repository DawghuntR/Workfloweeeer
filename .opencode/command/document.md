description: Update all documentation across the repository
agent: docstyle

Review all the features in the project using the @feature agent. Understand the goals, purpose, and functionality of the repository. Then, update or create the following documentation as needed:

1. **README.md** - Ensure it provides a clear overview of the project, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
2. **AGENTS.md** - AGENTS.md complements this by containing the extra, sometimes detailed context coding agents need: build steps, tests, and conventions that might clutter a README or aren't relevant to human contributors.
3. **STATUS.md** - Report on the overall status of the project, including completed features, ongoing work, and any known issues or bugs.

Then, iterate through all the code files in the repository. For each file, check if there is corresponding documentation that explains its purpose, functionality, and usage. If documentation is missing or outdated, create or update it accordingly. Make sure to relate documentation back to the relevant features documented by the @feature agent.

Ensure that all documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. Use appropriate formatting, headings, and examples to enhance readability. If applicable, include diagrams or screenshots to illustrate concepts or workflows.

Finally, review the entire documentation for consistency in style, tone, and terminology. Ensure that all links are functional and that any references to features or issues are accurate and up-to-date.
