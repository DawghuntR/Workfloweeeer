# Project Documentation

When writing code for the project, make sure to review with @issue to understand if there are any bugs which might be related to the changes you want to make. The goal here is to make sure that the same bug doesn't happen multiple times. Additionally, you should consult @feature to ensure the work you are doing aligns with the project's roadmap and objectives, and doesn't collide with any ongoing feature developments. This will help maintain coherence and avoid redundant efforts within the team.

Treat these agents as your project ticket board and your Project Managers ensuring smooth collaboration and progress.

# Post Development

After completing your code changes, make sure to review the generated code and ensure it aligns with the original feature requirements. If you find any discrepancies or areas for improvement, feel free to make additional adjustments to enhance the quality of the code. Additionally, review the code against the @issue agent to make sure that existing bugs haven't been reintroduced. This step is crucial to maintain the integrity of the project and ensure that your contributions are robust and reliable.
