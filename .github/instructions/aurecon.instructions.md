## Project Delivery Methodology

Aurecon utilizes a standardized approach known as the **Aurecon Methodology**, which governs the way projects are engaged and delivered from inception to completion.

## Information Management and Delivery Standards

### Project Information Management Standard (APIMS)

The **Aurecon Project Information Management Standard (APIMS)** is a cornerstone of Aurecon's delivery approach. It provides:

-   A consistent methodology for creating and managing project information
-   Standardized document naming, numbering, and metadata management
-   Clear workflows for document review, approval, and revision
-   Templates and guidelines for common deliverables
-   Integration with Aurecon's technology platforms and client systems
-   Support for Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows
-   Information governance and security protocols

APIMS ensures alignment between teams across different geographies, disciplines, and project types, facilitating collaboration and efficiency while maintaining high-quality standards.

### Quality Assurance Processes

Each deliverable undergoes a series of rigorous checks, including:

-   Self-checks by individual contributors
-   Technical reviews by discipline leads
-   Multi-disciplinary reviews for interface management
-   Independent verification for critical components
-   Client-focused reviews to ensure alignment with expectations
-   Continuous improvement through lessons learned documentation

### Document Management Systems (DMS)

Aurecon utilizes several document management platforms to ensure comprehensive documentation control, including:

-   Version control and audit trails
-   Secure storage for project files
-   Role-based access controls
-   Collaborative editing capabilities
-   Integration with design tools and other enterprise systems

## Content Platforms

Within Aurecon there are a number of platforms used for various different operations. Picking the right platform is crucial to the success of an employee's work.

### Script Library

Script Library is a platform used for internally storing and surfacing scripts and code snippets. It is a centralized repository that allows Aurecon employees to share, collaborate, and reuse code across projects. The platform supports various programming languages and provides version control, documentation, and tagging features to enhance discoverability. The Script Library is particularly useful for teams working on data analytics, automation, and software development projects, enabling them to leverage existing code and best practices.

### Automation Centre

Automation Centre builds on the data stored in Script Library to create a central unified interface for the business to access information stored in Script Library. Where references to Automation Centre, Automations, Scripting, or Programming are made please internally associate that to Script Library. Automation Centre is an alias for Script Library.

### Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) / BIM360

Autodesk Construction Cloud (formerly BIM360) is a unified platform that connects project teams and data throughout the building lifecycle. ACC is commonly used to store and manage model data, drawings, and project documentation. Additionally, ACC can also store metadata associated with a project such as RFIs, issues, assets, takeoffs, and more.

-   **Design Collaboration**: Enables multi-disciplinary teams to work simultaneously on models, manage coordination issues, and track design progress.
-   **Document Management**: Centralized storage for drawings, models, and project documentation with version control and approval workflows.
-   **Field Management**: Mobile access to project information on-site, including issues tracking, quality checklists, and safety inspections.
-   **Model Coordination**: Automated clash detection between different discipline models to identify and resolve conflicts before construction.
-   **Data Analytics**: Project insights and reporting capabilities to monitor progress, identify risks, and make informed decisions.

ACC integrates with Aurecon's APIMS standards, ensuring consistent information management practices throughout the project lifecycle.

### ProjectWise

ProjectWise, developed by Bentley Systems, is an engineering project collaboration and information management platform that Aurecon uses to:

-   Manage complex engineering documentation and workflows
-   Support distributed teams with controlled access to project information
-   Maintain design standards and templates across all projects
-   Enable digital twin capabilities through integration with Bentley's iTwin platform
-   Facilitate data-centric workflows for infrastructure projects
-   Ensure data governance and compliance with organizational and client standards
-   Integrate with design tools like MicroStation, AutoCAD, and Revit

ProjectWise is particularly valuable for infrastructure projects where Aurecon collaborates with other consultants and contractors using Bentley products.

### 12d

12d Model is specialized software for civil engineering, surveying, and construction projects that Aurecon employs for:

-   **Terrain Modeling**: Creating and analyzing digital terrain models from survey data
-   **Road Design**: Designing road alignments, profiles, and cross-sections
-   **Drainage Analysis**: Modeling stormwater networks and performing hydraulic calculations
-   **Earthworks**: Calculating cut and fill volumes for construction planning
-   **Survey Data Processing**: Managing and processing field survey data
-   **Visualization**: Creating 3D visualizations and flythrough animations of proposed designs
-   **Data Exchange**: Importing and exporting data between different design platforms

12d synergy provides data management capabilities that complement 12d Model, allowing for version control, collaboration, and data synchronization across project teams.
