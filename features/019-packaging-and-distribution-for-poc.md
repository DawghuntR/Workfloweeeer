# 019 - Packaging and Distribution for POC

Define how the Chrome extension and desktop app are packaged for local installation and POC distribution.

## Impact

Enables practical user testing and handoff to other agents without deployment complexity.

## Success Criteria

- Documented steps exist for installing/running the desktop app locally.
- Documented steps exist for loading the Chrome extension (unpacked is acceptable for POC).
- All components run offline and store data locally.

## Feedback

- POC target OS: Linux (development).
- Long-term target OS: Windows 11.
