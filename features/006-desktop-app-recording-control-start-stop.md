# 006 - Desktop App - Recording Control (Start/Stop)

Provide a desktop application that can start/stop a recording session for workflows involving desktop apps.

## Impact

Enables documentation of non-web processes (IDEs, native tools) which are common in consulting workflows.

## Success Criteria

- User can start/stop recording from a simple desktop UI.
- A global hotkey (configurable) can start/stop recording.
- Recording state is clearly visible to avoid accidental capture.

## Feedback

- Platform targets (Windows/macOS/Linux) should be clarified for implementation planning.
