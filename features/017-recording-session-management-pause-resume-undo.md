# 017 - Recording Session Management - Pause/Resume and Undo

Provide controls to pause/resume a recording session and undo the last captured step.

## Impact

Reduces noise in guides and improves usability for real-world workflow capture.

## Success Criteria

- User can pause and resume capture without creating confusing steps.
- User can undo the last step (removing its metadata and screenshot).
- UI clearly indicates paused vs recording.

## Feedback

- Undo can be limited to “last step” for POC.
