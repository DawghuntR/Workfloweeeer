# 004 - Chrome Extension - Screenshot Per Step

Capture a screenshot for each recorded step in the browser to produce a step-by-step visual guide.

## Impact

Screenshots are the primary output medium for the POC (no video), making the final guides easy to follow.

## Success Criteria

- A screenshot is captured for each step (or at least after each significant action), saved locally.
- Screenshot is linked to the corresponding step in the guide model (Feature 001).
- Screenshots are captured at a consistent resolution strategy (e.g., current viewport) and documented.

## Feedback

- Decide whether to capture before-action, after-action, or both; POC can default to after-action.
