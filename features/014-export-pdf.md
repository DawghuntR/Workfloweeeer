# 014 - Export - PDF

Export a guide to a PDF document containing the step-by-step instructions and screenshots.

## Impact

Meets common client deliverable expectations for consultants (portable, printable SOPs).

## Success Criteria

- User can export a guide to PDF.
- PDF includes guide title and all steps with screenshots and annotations.
- Output is deterministic and readable on standard page sizes (A4/Letter).

## Feedback

- Define PDF layout rules (one step per page vs flowing); POC can use a simple flowing layout.
