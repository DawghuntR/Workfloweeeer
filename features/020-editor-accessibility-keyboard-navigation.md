# 020 - Editor Accessibility - Keyboard Navigation

Ensure the step editor can be used efficiently with keyboard navigation (focus management, shortcuts).

## Impact

Improves usability for power users and reduces friction for consultants producing many SOPs.

## Success Criteria

- User can navigate steps with keyboard (up/down) and edit text fields without mouse.
- Basic shortcuts exist (save, export, delete step, undo).
- Focus states are visible and predictable.

## Feedback

- POC can prioritize the top 3 shortcuts (save/export/delete).
