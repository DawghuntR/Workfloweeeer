# 013 - Export - HTML Workflow Viewer

Export a guide to a web-based HTML viewer that can be opened locally (no hosting required).

## Impact

Provides an immediately shareable artifact in the POC via local files (e.g., zip, folder) even without link sharing.

## Success Criteria

- User can export a guide as an HTML bundle (or single HTML file with assets).
- Output renders: title, step list, step text, screenshots, and annotations.
- Exported viewer works offline when opened from disk.

## Feedback

- Clarify whether to support iframe embedding later; out of scope for POC.
