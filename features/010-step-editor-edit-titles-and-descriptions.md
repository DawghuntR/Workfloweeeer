# 010 - Step Editor - Edit Titles and Descriptions

Allow users to edit the guide title and the text for each step (short title + longer description).

## Impact

Makes guides understandable to non-authors and suitable for formal documentation.

## Success Criteria

- User can edit guide title.
- User can edit step title and step description.
- Edits are persisted locally (Feature 016) and reflected in all exports (Features 013–015).

## Feedback

- POC can default to auto-generated placeholder text until AI is added (Feature 022).
