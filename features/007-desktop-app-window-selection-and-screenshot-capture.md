# 007 - Desktop App - Window Selection and Screenshot Capture

Allow the desktop recorder to capture screenshots during a session, scoped to a selected window/app or to the full screen (configurable).

## Impact

Creates visual, step-based desktop guides without requiring video recording.

## Success Criteria

- User can choose capture scope: selected window or full screen.
- A screenshot can be taken automatically per step or manually via hotkey.
- Screenshots are saved locally and linked to steps in the guide model (Feature 001).

## Feedback

- POC can start with manual screenshot-per-step via hotkey if automatic step detection is not ready.
