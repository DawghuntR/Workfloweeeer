# 011 - Step Editor - Annotate Screenshots

Enable basic screenshot annotation tools (arrows, boxes, highlights, text labels) per step.

## Impact

Improves clarity of SOPs, especially for complex UIs or small targets.

## Success Criteria

- User can add, edit, and remove annotations on a step screenshot.
- Annotations are stored in the guide model (as vector/overlay data) and rendered in HTML/PDF exports.
- Annotation editing is responsive for typical screenshot sizes.

## Feedback

- Decide whether annotations are baked into images on export or layered (both acceptable if documented).
