# 021 - Performance and Reliability - Offline and Large Guides

Keep capture and editing stable for longer workflows (many steps/screenshots) while operating fully offline.

## Impact

Prevents the tool from failing during real SOP capture sessions and builds trust in the output.

## Success Criteria

- Capture can record at least 100 steps with screenshots without crashing.
- Editor remains usable (reasonable load time and scroll performance) for large guides.
- All features work without network access.

## Feedback

- Define performance targets (time/memory) once the implementation stack is known.
