# 012 - Step Editor - Retake or Replace Screenshot

Let users replace a screenshot for a step (e.g., retake after fixing a mistake) without re-recording the entire workflow.

## Impact

Reduces rework and makes the tool usable for real consulting documentation where changes happen frequently.

## Success Criteria

- User can select a step and replace its screenshot from:
  - a new capture action (retake), or
  - an imported image file
- Replaced screenshot updates exports and local storage references.

## Feedback

- POC can start with “import image file” if retake capture is complex.
